This file summarizes changes made between Turbo Professional versions
5.21 and 5.22. It is of interest primarily to Fast Update Plan
subscribers.

The primary reason for the release of Turbo Professional 5.22 is to
bring the software in line with the new Second Edition Turbo
Professional manual. The new manual incorporates all of the
information previously found in the READ.ME file and auxiliary DOC
files. See READ.ME for more information about obtaining the new
manual.
